# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Overview
### AutosRUs' newest prototype, the MechaCar, is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team's progress. I will be reviewing the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing team.

### Summary of Linear Regression to Predict MPG
#### * Vehicle length and vehicle ground clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to mpg values.
#### * The slope of the linear model would not be considered to be zero as the p-Value of this model is 5.35e-11 which is much smaller than the signifcance level of .05% and there is sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.
#### * The linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. The r-squared is 0.71, meaning that approximately 71% of the variability of the dependent variable is explained using this linear model.
